            <h3>When it all started: November 5, 2020, 8:40 PM EST</h3>
            <P>Episode 18 of season 15 airs. Castiel, angel of the Lord confesses his love for Dean Winchester and gets taken away by the Empty. Meanwhile the presidential election is going on in the United States of America. Trump and Biden are neck to
                neck. Everyone is waiting for the result of the election to finally come out, determining the course of American history for the next four year. Destiel trends above the election on twitter. Fans are going insane. For some reason, so is
                Vladimir Putin, the famous Russian monarch who, after hearing the knews of destiel having become canon, reveals his decision to step down from power. The electoral votes are finally out. It is announced that Joe Biden is going to be the
                46th president of the United States of America. "Is this for real?" the fans ask themselves in disbelief. Destiel is canon. Castiel, angel of the Lord is canonically gay and in love with Dean Winchester. Putin has stepped down from power.
                Joe Biden has won the 46th election. This is a day to be remembered.</P>
            <aside>
                <p>Misha Collins has an online panel in which he declares Castiel's confession to be <q>a homosexual declaration
            of love</q> and an example of <q>the bury the gays trope</q>.</p>
            </aside>
            <h3>Destiel is canon: November 5 to November 12, 2020, 8 PM EST</h3>
            <P>The fans are going crazy all over the place. What is going to happen next? Can we expect to hear Dean's confession? The meta writers who had already predicted Castiel's confession to Dean are all over Tumblr telling us what to expect next.
                The cast are pretending that this was Misha's goodbye, the fans however, having proof of Misha's self-quarantine period in Vancouver, have hope that Castiel will be back. Misha himself has a panel in which he asserts that Castiel's confession
                was a <q>homosexual declaration of love.</q>The whole cast are coming out as<br>hellers, saying stuff like "yeah we knew" and "of course he's in love with Dean." These are very exciting times for the S*pernatural fandom. Everyone is excited
                for what's to come next and then 15X19 hits.</P>
            <h3>Inherit The Earth: November 12 to November 19 2020, 8 PM EST</h3>
            <p>The Episode is a complete disaster. Some describe it as a "fake" episode. Castiel's confession has been swiped under Buckleming's rug. There are only three mentions of Castiel through out the whole episode. The episode is a rush, a last miniute
                attempt to resolve the storyline of season 15 in 42 minutes. Character developments are erased, the climax is stale, the camera angels look off, there is a very cringe-worthy clip at the end of the episode. Dean doesn't even mention that
                Cas confessed his love to him in a beautiful and heart-felt declaration. Sam doesn't mention Eileen, the love of his love who's just supposed to have come back from the dead. To be fair, as far as destiel goes, there are also clues in
                the episode which tell the faithful destihellers not to despair. Dean offers to kill himself and Sam in order to bring Cas back, he rushes up the stairs so fucking fast, he passes out on the floor from drinking too much. He is, in a way,
                a very weird way, mourning Castiel, maybe, but the in a way that is characteristic of Dean <i> War Widower</i> Winchester to mourn the death of Castiel. Every fucking thing about the episode feels absolutely off. CASTIEL is carved on the
                map room table, We have theorists and meta writers saying the episode was bad on purpose. We are clowns, but we keep having hope. It seems like the only thing left to do, is bring Cas back and give the boys a happy ending. We have faith.
                We have hope. The clues, the storylines, the parallels tell us so.</P>
            <h3>Carry on: November 19, 2020, 8 PM EST</h3>
            <P><cite>The Long Way Home</cite> airs before the series finale. The cast and the crew say tearful goodbyes, everyone's telling us how much they love us, Kripke says that he loves the meta episodes, giving us clowns more hope that maybe they
                really are gonna go there, reassuring us that it is the only thing left to do, the only way to be free, to give the boys the happy ending they deserve. In retrospect, there are also signs telling us to turn around and never watch the damned
                thing. Misha says <q>you can always write your own ending,</q> gloomily foreshadowing the disappointing finale we're about to watch.<br>The episode starts without playing <cite>Carry On Wayward Son</cite>, the anthem of the Winchesters,
                a song that's been played in every finale since season 1. Something feels off.Sam shows up shirtless, with a towel around his waist which is so very weird. We're not that kind of a show? The Winchesters are doing domestic stuff, melting
                our hearts, giving us hope, but no. As Misha once so rightfully put it, <q>in supernatural, just when there is a flicker of hope, the rug gets swiped from under your feet.</q> And that is exactly what happened. Castiel, Eileen, and Jack,
                the Winchesters' chosen family, have been erased from the narrative. There is literally no mention of Eileen and only a half-assed excuse of a mention of Cas and Jack that comes from Sam. Dean isn't even allowed to mention Cas' name. Long
                story short, the episode sucks. It is a disaster. It means us want to crawl back to Buckleming and thank him for last week's episode. Character developments that have been build over the past 15 years are erased and ignored. The episode
                gives off weird Wincest vibes, the whole thing feels like a hoax, like at any point they are going to tell us that it was all a joke, that the real episode will air later, but alas, it is not. Dean dies on a rusty fucking nail, on a vampire
                hunt, of all things, and goes to heaven. Sam lives on after him, marrying a blurry-faced woman of undetermined identity and names his weird ugly kid Dean Jr. He also gets a party wig, so good for him. The only time Cas and Jack are mentioned
                is when Bobby tells Dean that Jack brought Cas back from the empty and they rebuilt heaven together. Dean drives Baby for like a couple minutes in heaven, but those minutes pass like years for Sam, he grows old and dies and joins Dean
                in heaven. Cas and Jack are never seen. Eileen is erased. No one is at Dean's funeral. The finale is a disaster.
            </P>
            <h3>"They can't fire me": Misha's panel, November 22, 2020</h3>
            <p>Many memes and scandalous IMDB reviews later, Misha Collins has a virtual panel in which he reveals plans for an original ending which was revoked due to covid-19. <q>What are they gonna do? Fire me? The shows over</q> he says, as he reveals
                that Jimmy Novak, Castiel's vessel, was planed to make an appearance in Dean's heaven. He gives us contradictory statements about an original ending while being cautious because he doesn't want to be the first person in the cast to spill
                the beans. In happier news, he also says that Castiel's wings are rainbow colored, resulting in many beautiful fan arts. Also, here is a fanart example and the complete video of Misha's panel on November 22, 2020:</p>

            <h3>Archetypes and story telling techniques: Jared's panel, November 22, 2020</h3>
            <p>On the same day as Misha's panel, Jared has an online Q&A panel in which he praises the series finale for being so great and says <q>being familiar with archetypes and story telling techniques, [he] really liked the ending.</q> He even goes
                so far as to say that <cite>Carry On</cite> is his favorite episode of all time. He also says that he thinks the reason Sam was wearing the same clothes he was wearing back in the <cite>
            Pilot</cite> is because Sam's heaven is the day Dean came to get him at Standford. This, of course, makes the fans laugh, because what the fuck, Jarpad? The day his girlfriend, the love of his life, burnt on the ceiling? The day he had to
                leave behind the life he fought so hard to achieve? That day, Jarpad? Like Misha, Jared also reveals that original plans for the finale were a little bit different, stating that Dean's heaven was originally supposed to be filled with all
                the people from his past that he loved, but due to covid-19 restrictions, they couldn't get everyone together. This statement, however, is problematic due to the reasons I have listed below:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>We were shown a behind the scenes short clip after the series finale in which there were literally like a \ hundred people on set and they weren't even wearing a mask. (to be fair, maybe they had taken their masks off to film the goodbye
                    video, but the point is, it would not have made any difference if two other people were added to that crowd.
                </li>
                <li>Fan
                    </mas have asked around on Twitter and according to the actors, no one asked them to be in the series finale even pre-covid-19. In other words, they did not plan for anyone to be in Dean 's heaven.
        (except, of course, Jimmy Novak, apparently, for some reason.)</li>
    </ol>
<p>In conclusion, Jared is a <del>corporate tool.</del> AnYWaY, here's the complete video of Jared 's panel where you
can watch him talk about the finale like he has never watched the show:</p>
